# AP-Doku
A full-featured Sudoku game built with SwiftUI, featuring Archipelago Multi-World integration.  Now you can get hints for your games while BK'd from your phone!

## Features
- AP Integration!
- 4 difficulty levels, including "Killer" mode, which takes the difficulty of Hard mode and adds cages around number cells to show their end number totals.
- Hints are granted for your entered slot based on the difficulty of the puzzle you selected.
- Simple design, in line with the AP logo colors.
- Alerts telling you what hints you are getting for your connected slot.
- An alert to tell you if your game no longer has any more hints.
- Hint caching, so if you are disconnected when playing, it will send the hints when you reconnect. (Not much testing has been done with this, but it should work)

## Contributions:
This is based on a fork of https://github.com/jaredcassoutt/sudoku_swiftui.  I have changed UI elements, changed some of the puzzle logic, removed a some unneeded features for this deployment, and added the AP integration.  Without the linked repo, this project would have had no base, so thank you to the author!


Feel free to fork the project, submit issues, or suggest improvements. Feedback and ideas for new features are welcome!
